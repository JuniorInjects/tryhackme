If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use?
&

If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named "passwords" with the word "password123", what would my command be?
echo password123 > password

Now if I wanted to add "tryhackme" to this file named "passwords" but also keep "passwords123", what would my command be
echo tryhackme >> password
